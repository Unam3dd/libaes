/*
 * 										AES Algorithm
 *
 * 	Cipher Key:
 * 		AES is a symmetric key encryption algorithm (The same key is used to encrypt and decrypt). 
 * 		It uses a cipher key whose length is 128 bits, 192 bits or 256 bits. 
 * 		The AES algorithm with a cipher key of length 128, 192, 256 bits is denoted 
 *		AES-128, AES-192, AES-256, respectively.
 *
 *
 *
 *	State:
 *		The process of encryption/decryption of plaintext/ciphertext to ciphertext/plaintext
 *		generates intermediate 128-bit results. These intermediate results are referred to as the
 *		State.
 *
 *
 *
 * 	Data Blocks:
 * 		AES operates on an input data block of 128 bits and its output is also a data block of
 * 		128 bits. 
 *
 * 		(Note) The size of an "Data blocks" is alway 128 bits even if use 192 or 256 bits AES algorithms
 * 		The principal difference reside in the key, the key size must be changed if you use AES-128,192 or 256 bits
 *		but not Data blocks.
 *
 *
 *
 *	Round Keys:
 *		AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 algorithms expand the cipher key to 10, 12, and 14
 *		round keys, respectively. The length of each round key is 128 bits. The algorithm for
 *		deriving the round keys from the cipher key is the called the AES Key Expansion.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *	AES Key Expansion or AES Key Scheduling:
 *		What is AES Key Expansion, The AES Key Expansion Algorithm or AES Key Scheduling 
 *		is a key scheduler used by AES Algorithm.
 *
 *		The AES key expansion algorithm is a crucial part of the AES encryption process.
 *		This Algorithm generates a series of round keys from the original cipher key. 
 *		These round keys are used in each encryption or decryption round.
 *
 *		Note: 
 *		Bear in mind that each round has its own key generated by the AES key expansion algorithm from the encryption key.
 *
 *		The AES Key Expansion algorithms is defined as follow:
 *			Initial Key: The user provides the original key (128, 192, or 256 bits).
 *			Rounds and Round Keys: AES operates in rounds (10, 12, or 14 rounds depending on key size), and each round requires its own unique round key.
 *			Word Formation: The original key is split into 32-bit words, which are used to generate new words for the expanded key.
 *			RotWord & SubWord: The RotWord operation rotates the bytes of a word, and SubWord applies the S-box substitution to each byte.
 *			Rcon (Round Constant): A round-dependent constant is XORed with the transformed word to increase variability in the round keys.
 *			XOR Operations: New words are generated by XORing previous words, ensuring that each round key is unique.
 *
 *			RotWord (Rotate Word)
 *			SubWord (Substitute Word)
 *			Rcon (Round Constant)
 *			XOR Operation

* @prototype aes_ctr_enc/aes_ctr_dec
*
* @brief  That function encrypt your data with
* 	AES-CTR mode operation.
*
*	This implementation work with Counter/LFSR
*
*	The structure of the counter is just a random nonce of 8, 12, or 16 bytes.
*	A nonce is just a random bytes, The counter is just a integer and start at 0.
*
*	So the High part of the Counter structure is the nonce and low part is the counter.
*
*	NOTE: In some implementation the counter is in big-endian take care of it.
*	WARNING: The user should not use the same IV (Same nonce with same key for sure), in case
*	of this behavior is performed this implementation is vulnerable to key-reused attack because AES-CTR transform
*	a block cipher in stream cipher.
*
* @param[in] byte_t: 		*out	Pointer to the output buffer where the encrypted data will be stored.
* @param[in] size_t:		o_sz	This value is the size of the output buffer.
* @param[in] aes_counter_t: *iv		This pointer represent a structure in memory of IV (Initialize Vector) It contains a nonce and a integer counter.
* @param[in] const byte_t:	*in		This pointer is the input buffer, there is the data you can encrypt.
* @param[in] size_t:		i_sz	This is the size of the input bytes you want encrypt.
* @param[in] aes_ctx_t:		ctx		There is the context of your aes session contain the key, size of the key (etc...).
* 
*
*
* @return int             Returns sum of a + b.
